        # At present, the Windows VMs only come with the copy of GnuPG that's bundled
        # with Git for Windows. If we want to use this version _and_ be able to set
        # arbitrary GnuPG home directories, then the test would need to figure out when
        # to convert Windows-style paths into Unix-style paths with cygpath, which is
        # unreasonable.
        #
        # Instead, we'll install a version of GnuPG that can handle Windows-style paths.
        # However, due to <https://dev.gnupg.org/T5593>, installation fails if the PATH
        # environment variable is too long. Consequently, we need to shorten PATH to
        # something minimal before we can install GnuPG. For further details, see
        # <https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/2876>.
        #
        # Additionally, we'll explicitly set `gpg.program` to ensure Git for Windows
        # doesn't invoke the bundled GnuPG, otherwise we'll run into
        # <https://dev.gnupg.org/T5504>. See also: <https://dev.gnupg.org/T3020>.

        # it via Chocolatey using the 'hg' package.
