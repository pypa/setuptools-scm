# Usage

## at build time

The preferred way to configure `setuptools-scm` is to author
settings in the `tool.setuptools_scm` section of `pyproject.toml`.

It's necessary to use a setuptools version released after 2022.

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=64", "setuptools-scm>=8"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
# version = "0.0.1"  # Remove any existing version parameter.
dynamic = ["version"]

[tool.setuptools_scm]
# can be empty if no extra settings are needed, presence enables setuptools-scm
```

That will be sufficient to require `setuptools-scm` for projects
that support PEP 518 ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) and
[pep517](https://pypi.org/project/pep517/)).
Tools that still invoke `setup.py` must ensure build requirements are installed

### version files

```toml title="pyproject.toml"
...
[tool.setuptools_scm]
version_file = "pkg/_version.py"
```

Where `pkg` is the name of your package.

```commandline
$ python -m setuptools_scm

# To explore other options, try:
$ python -m setuptools_scm --help
```

## as cli tool

If you need to confirm which version string is being generated
or debug the configuration, you can install
[setuptools-scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools-scm)
directly in your working environment and run:

```commandline
$ python -m setuptools_scm # example from running local after changes
7.1.1.dev149+g5197d0f.d20230727
```

and to list all tracked by the scm:

```commandline
$ python -m setuptools_scm ls # output trimmed for brevity
./LICENSE
...
./src/setuptools_scm/__init__.py
./src/...
...
```

!!! note "committed files only"

    currently only committed files are listed, this might change in the future

!!! warning "sdists/archives don't provide file lists"

    currently there is no builtin mechanism
    to safely transfer the file lists to sdists or obtaining them from archives
    coordination for setuptools and hatch is ongoing

## at runtime (strongly discouraged)

the most simple **looking** way to use `setuptools-scm` at runtime is:

```python
from setuptools_scm import get_version
version = get_version()
```

In order to use `setuptools-scm` from code that is one directory deeper
than the project's root, you can use:

```python
from setuptools_scm import get_version
version = get_version(root='..', relative_to=__file__)
```

## Python package metadata

### version at runtime

If you have opted not to hardcode the version number inside the package,
you can retrieve it at runtime from [PEP-0566](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0566/) metadata using
`importlib.metadata` from the standard library (added in Python 3.8)
or the [`importlib_metadata`](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/) backport:

```python title="package_name/__init__.py"
from importlib.metadata import version, PackageNotFoundError

try:
    __version__ = version("package-name")
except PackageNotFoundError:
    # package is not installed
    pass
```

### Usage from Sphinx

```{.python file=docs/.entangled/sphinx_conf.py}
from importlib.metadata import version as get_version
release: str = get_version("package-name")
# for example take major/minor
version: str = ".".join(release.split('.')[:2])
```

The underlying reason is that services like _Read the Docs_ sometimes change
the working directory for good reasons and using the installed metadata
prevents using needless volatile data there.

## with Docker/Podman

In some situations, Docker may not copy the `.git` into the container when
building images. Because of this, builds with version inference may fail.

The following snippet exposes the external `.git` directory without copying.
This allows the version to be inferred properly form inside the container
without copying the entire `.git` folder into the container image.

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=source=.git,target=.git,type=bind \
    pip install --no-cache-dir -e .
```

However, this build step introduces a dependency to the state of your local
`.git` folder the build cache and triggers the long-running pip install process on every build.
To optimize build caching, one can use an environment variable to pretend a pseudo
version that is used to cache the results of the pip install process:

```dockerfile
FROM python
COPY pyproject.toml
ARG PSEUDO_VERSION=1 # strongly recommended to update based on git describe
RUN SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION_FOR_MY_PACKAGE=${PSEUDO_VERSION} pip install -e .[test]
RUN --mount=source=.git,target=.git,type=bind pip install -e .
```

Note that running this Dockerfile requires docker with BuildKit enabled
[docs](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/v0.8.3/frontend/dockerfile/docs/syntax.md).

To avoid BuildKit and mounting of the .git folder altogether, one can also pass the desired
version as a build argument.
Note that `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION_FOR_${NORMALIZED_DIST_NAME}`
is preferred over `SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION`.

## Default versioning scheme

In the standard configuration `setuptools-scm` takes a look at three things:

1. latest tag (with a version number)
2. the distance to this tag (e.g. number of revisions since latest tag)
3. workdir state (e.g. uncommitted changes since latest tag)

and uses roughly the following logic to render the version:

| distance | state     | format                                                               |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| no       | unchanged | `{tag}`                                                              |
| yes      | unchanged | `{next_version}.dev{distance}+{scm letter}{revision hash}`           |
| no       | changed   | `{tag}+dYYYYMMDD`                                                    |
| yes      | changed   | `{next_version}.dev{distance}+{scm letter}{revision hash}.dYYYYMMDD` |

where `{next_version}` is the next version number after the latest tag

The next version is calculated by adding `1` to the last numeric component of
the tag.

For Git projects, the version relies on [git describe](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe),
so you will see an additional `g` prepended to the `{revision hash}`.

!!! note

    According to [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#local-version-identifiers>),
    if a version includes a local component, the package cannot be published to public
    package indexes like PyPI or TestPyPI. The disallowed version segments may
    be seen in auto-publishing workflows or when a configuration mistake is made.

    However, some package indexes such as devpi or other alternatives allow local
    versions. Local version identifiers must comply with [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/#local-version-identifiers>).

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Due to the default behavior it's necessary to always include a
patch version (the `3` in `1.2.3`), or else the automatic guessing
will increment the wrong part of the SemVer (e.g. tag `2.0` results in
`2.1.devX` instead of `2.0.1.devX`). So please make sure to tag
accordingly.

## Builtin mechanisms for obtaining version numbers

1. the SCM itself (Git/Mercurial)
2. `.hg_archival` files (Mercurial archives)
3. `.git_archival.txt` files (Git archives, see subsection below)
4. `PKG-INFO`

### Git archives

Git archives are supported, but a few changes to your repository are required.

Ensure the content of the following files:

```{ .text file=".git_archival.txt"}

node: $Format:%H$
node-date: $Format:%cI$
describe-name: $Format:%(describe:tags=true,match=*[0-9]*)$
```

Feel free to alter the `match` field in `describe-name` to match your project's
tagging style.

!!! note

    If your git host provider does not properly expand `describe-name`, you may
    need to include `ref-names: $Format:%D$`. But **beware**, this can often
    lead to the git archive's checksum changing after a commit is added
    post-release. See [this issue][git-archive-issue] for more details.

```{.text file=".gitattributes"}
.git_archival.txt  export-subst
```

Finally, don't forget to commit the two files:

```commandline
$ git add .git_archival.txt .gitattributes && git commit -m "add export config"
```

Note that if you are creating a `_version.py` file, note that it should not
be kept in version control. It's strongly recommended to be put into gitignore.

### File finders hook makes most of `MANIFEST.in` unnecessary

`setuptools-scm` implements a [file_finders] entry point
which returns all files tracked by your SCM.
This eliminates the need for a manually constructed `MANIFEST.in` in most cases where this
would be required when not using `setuptools-scm`, namely:

- To ensure all relevant files are packaged when running the `sdist` command.
  - When using [include_package_data] to include package data as part of the `build` or `bdist_wheel`.

`MANIFEST.in` may still be used: anything defined there overrides the hook.
This is mostly useful to exclude files tracked in your SCM from packages,
although in principle it can be used to explicitly include non-tracked files too.
