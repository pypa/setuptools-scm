### warning

This release explicitly warns on unsupported setuptools. This
unfortunately has to happen as the legacy `setup_requires` mechanism
incorrectly configures the setuptools working-set when a more recent
setuptools version than available is required.

As all releases of setuptools are affected as the historic mechanism for
ensuring a working setuptools setup was shipping a `ez_setup` file next
to `setup.py`, which would install the required version of setuptools.

This mechanism has long since been deprecated and removed as most people
haven\'t been using it
