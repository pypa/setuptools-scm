.. warning::

   This release explicitly warns on unsupported setuptools.
   This unfortunately has to happen as the legacy ``setup_requires`` mechanism
   incorrectly configures the setuptools working-set when a more recent setuptools
   version than available is required.

   As all releases of setuptools are affected as the historic mechanism
   for ensuring a working setuptools setup was shipping a ``ez_setup`` file
   next to ``setup.py``, which would install the required version of setuptools.

   This mechanism has long since been deprecated and removed
   as most people haven't been using it
