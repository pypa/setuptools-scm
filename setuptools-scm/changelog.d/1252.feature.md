Version files (``write_to`` and ``version_file``) are now written to the build directory
during ``build_py`` instead of the source tree during version inference.
This enables installing packages from read-only source directories (e.g., Bazel builds).

Path transformation is automatically applied for ``src/`` layouts - a configured path like
``src/mypackage/_version.py`` is correctly written to ``mypackage/_version.py`` in the
build directory based on the ``package_dir`` configuration.

To restore the old behavior of writing version files at inference time (useful for
development workflows), set the environment variable ``SETUPTOOLS_SCM_WRITE_TO_SOURCE=1``.
